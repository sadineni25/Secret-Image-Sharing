# Secret-Image-Sharing
A new approach to secret image sharing based on a ðk; nÞ-threshold scheme with the additional capabilities of steganography and authentication.

A secret image is first processed into n shares which are then hidden in n user-selected camouflage images.

During the secret image recovery process, each stego-image brought by a participant is first verified for its fidelity by checking the consistency of the parity conditions found in the image pixels. This helps to prevent the participant from incidental or intentional provision of a false or tampered stego-image.
The recovery process is stopped if any abnormal stego-image is found. Otherwise, the secret image is recovered from k or more authenticated stego-images.

The proposed scheme as a whole offers a high secure and effective mechanism for secret image sharing.
